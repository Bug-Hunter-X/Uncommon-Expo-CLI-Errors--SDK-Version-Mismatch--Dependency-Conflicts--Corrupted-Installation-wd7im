Several approaches can address this issue. First, ensure your `package.json`'s `expo` SDK version aligns with the installed version. Run `expo upgrade` to update your project. If the mismatch persists, try deleting your `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Next, confirm that your `expo-cli` is up-to-date using `expo --version` and update if needed with `npm install -g expo-cli@latest`.  If the problem remains, a global reset of the Expo CLI might be necessary, which requires uninstalling and reinstalling it.  If dependency issues exist, carefully examine the error messages from npm or yarn for specific conflicting dependencies and then take appropriate action such as adjusting version numbers in `package.json` or using the `resolutions` field to specify specific versions of packages.
