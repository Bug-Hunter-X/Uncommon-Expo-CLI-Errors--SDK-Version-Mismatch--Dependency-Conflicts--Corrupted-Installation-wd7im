This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage a React Native project and arises from inconsistencies or conflicts within the project's configuration files or dependencies.  One common cause is a mismatch between the Expo SDK version specified in your `package.json` and the actual version installed. Another potential reason is an outdated or corrupted `expo-cli` installation itself.  Sometimes, this error can also manifest after changes to dependencies and resolving the dependencies with npm or yarn.
